# weatherFlow: weather & spotify app

https://patrickgp.github.io/Spotify-Weather-App/

  Our goal for this project was to combine two server-side APIs (Spotify's API and OpenWeatherMaps API) to form an application that could provide the weather for a user selected location and combine the current forecast with a playlist generated by specific weather conditions. We used the Materialize Framework to handle CSS styling. We avoided using alerts, confirms, or prompts to collect input from the user and focused on making sure our application was responsive, interactive, and intuitive. We use client-side storage to store persistent data such as location, access tokens, etc. We are confident in our MVP and are excited for future development opportunities that are in the works.
